By doing Google Image search this tells us that this is somewhere in China.
Chinese HSR does not look like the one in the image, they're all basically white, with blue, red or yellow stripes. The line in the image is a metro line.
By reading the license plate, one is from Shanxi province, which barely has any metro, so it's just a random out of state car. The other one is from Suzhou City, which does have a green line, but it's entirely underground.
If you look up the Shanghai metro green line, its carriages do not look like that, but Wuxi City, which neighbours Suzhou City, does have subway of this livery. Its metro is also mostly over the ground.
Looking around the City of Wuxi, the only Highway wide enuogh to be a 8-lane highway with road shoulders is the G2 Beijing-Shanghai expressway. We can find the intersection of G2 and line 2 on the map, which is next to Wuxi IKEA.
Oh man I miss IKEA. Gotta visit it some time later I guess.
