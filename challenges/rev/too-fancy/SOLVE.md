This is a compiled tcl program into bytecode.

The first step is to reverse engineer the bytecode into source code using https://github.com/corbamico/tbcload.

Then, you must reverse engineer the program. The program consists of a 37 x 37 matrix multiplication (A) with your input (x) and checks if it is equal to the desired output (b).

However, the matrix multiplication is disguised. The matrix is filled in reverse-diagonal order - for a 4x4, starting at 1, that looks like:

7  4  2  1
11 8  5  3
14 12 9  6
16 15 13 10

And then a specialized formula is used to get each row of the input based on the Lazy Caterers Sequence. E.g. for row idx=1, the formula outputs 3,5,8,11 so the original variables can be referenced correctly.

After this is understood, you simply do:

x = A^-1 @ b

The flag is:
