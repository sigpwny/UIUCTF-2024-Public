Hi, thanks for doing modmail for X Marked The Spot
Here are some good modmail **hints**.
Do **not** give away answers.
This is not a purely beginner CTF.
**HOWEVER** this is a baby chal so be gentle to people.

* They should figure out what xor is and how it works.

* They should consider the flag format.
This is sort of the meat of the chal, giving anything away kinda defeats the point.
