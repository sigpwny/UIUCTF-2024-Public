Hi, thanks for doing modmail for Without a Trace.
Here are some good modmail **hints**.
Do **not** give away answers.
This is not a purely beginner CTF.

* They need to figure out what function `check(M)` is computing.
It's a common function on matrices they really should be able to figure it out.
It's even the same one from `Determined`.

* They need to isolate each number on the diagonal of the matrix.
There are multiple ways to do it.
This is sort of the meat of the chal, giving anything away kinda defeats the point.
