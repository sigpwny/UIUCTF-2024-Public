Solution code can be found in `sol.py`.

We are given a flag with takes inputs `u1, u2, u3, u4, u5`.
From this, we get a response which is the trace `tr(M)` of the matrix `M` defined as follows:
```
M = [
    [u1*f1, 0,   0,   0,   0  ],
    [  0, u2*f2, 0,   0,   0  ],
    [  0,   0, u3*f3, 0,   0  ],
    [  0,   0,   0, u4*f4, 0  ],
    [  0,   0,   0,   0, u5*f4],
]
```
where each `f1, ..., f5` is defined as
```
f1 = bytes_to_long(bytes(FLAG[0 :5]))
f2 = bytes_to_long(bytes(FLAG[5 :10]))
f3 = bytes_to_long(bytes(FLAG[10:15]))
f4 = bytes_to_long(bytes(FLAG[15:20]))
f5 = bytes_to_long(bytes(FLAG[20:25]))
```
Recall that `tr(M)` is the sum of the entries along the main diagonal of `M`.
So if we can find `f1, ..., f5` we can recover the flag.

We have to pick our values `u1, ..., u5` such that `check(M)` is nonzero.
Those familiar with algebra will recognize that `check(M)` actually computes `det(M)` via the [Leibniz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leibniz_formula_for_determinants).
This is a non-recursive formula for computing the determinant which makes it nice to implement as finding minors of the matrix is annoying.
To make sure `check(M) != 0`, it suffices to make sure that `u1*f1, ..., u5*f5` is non-zero since then the columns will be linearly independent.
This removes the extremely trivial solution of extracting `fi` by setting `ui = 1` and `uj = 0` for `j != i` and making 5 such queries.

Here is how my solution worked, although there are number of viable solutions.
The idea is that we make each `ui` a large power of 10 `k` so that the trace ends up being each `fi` padded by a few `0`s.
Once we have this, we can then just do some string manipulation to get each `fi`.
First, we compute the sum of the `ui` by setting each `fi = 1`.
This gives us a lower bound on how many `0`s we need our power of 10 to have.
Doing this gives us a total sum of `2000128101369`.
With this information, set our power of 10 `k = 10000000000000000`.

Armed with this, we query the oracle again setting each
```
u1 =k^0,
u2 =k^1,
u3 =k^2,
u4 =k^3,
u5 =k^4.
```
Then the total result
```
4658061070050000163852545397000042603108131100004401578931720000504280474484
```
This gives us some padding of 4 `0`s between each of the `fi`.
Using this, we get that each of the `ui` are the following values after stripping off the padding of 4 `0`s.
```
u5 = 465806107005,
u4 = 163852545397,
u3 = 426031081311,
u2 = 440157893172,
u1 = 504280474484.
```
Some string manipulation gives us the final ciphertext:

`flag = uiuctf{tr4c1ng_&&_mult5!}`.
