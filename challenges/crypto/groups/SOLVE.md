The solution to this challenge has two main parts: finding a large (>512 bit) carmichael number and solving a discrete log problem modulo that number. 

There is more than one way to find large Carmichael numbers. My solve uses the method described here: https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3029794/large-carmichael-number (TD;DR: find n such that (6n + 1), (12n + 1), and (18n + 1) are prime. Then c = (6n + 1)(12n + 1)(18n + 1) is a Carmichael number)

Once we have a Carmichael number, we can use the Pohlig-Hellman method to solve the discrete log problem. This method can efficiently solve the discrete log problem in a cyclic group of order k if k - 1 has small factors. In this case, we don't know the order of the cyclic group generated by the base, but we do know that it is a subgroup of the multiplicative group mod c, which has order phi(c) = phi(6n + 1)(12n + 1)(18n + 1) = (6n)(12n)(18n). If we choose n to be smooth, phi(c) will be smooth as well. At this point we can use Pohlig-Hellman with phi(c) instead of the true order of the cyclic group. 

Calling the Pohlig-Hellman function in a CAS at this point will likely not work though, since the CAS will try to find the order of the multiplicative group, which is very slow. Instead, we need to implement part Pohlig-Hellman ourselves (my solve uses the baby-step-giant-step function in Sage to solve the DLP in subgroups and the CRT function in Sage to combine results).
