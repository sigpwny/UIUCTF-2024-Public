Hi, thanks for doing modmail for Groups
Here are some good modmail hints. 
Do not give away answers.
This is not a purely beginner CTF.
Essentially no part of this challenge involves guesswork, so you shouldn't have to give many hints. 

They need to figure out that the check() function checks if c is a Carmichael number

They need to then find a large (> 512 bit) Carmichael number. There is more than one way to do this. 

Once they have a Carmichael number, they need to solve a discrete log problem modulo the carmichael number. The simplest way to solve the DLP is probably with the Pohlig-Hellman method. THey need to figure this out and generate a Carmichael number that makes Pohlig-Hellman efficient (the totient of the carmichael number should be smooth). They also need to likely reimplement part of Pohlig-Hellman.
